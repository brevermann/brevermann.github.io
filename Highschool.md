## High School
I went to **Mater Dei Catholic High School**. My graduating class was a total of **94** kids. It wasnt a very big High School but it was perfect. It was located in a small town so I already knew almost my entire class before I even stepped into the place but I liked it that wasy. But the main reason I came to Mizoou was becuase I was tired of that and wanted new faces. My high School was an athletic and academic powerhouse. We were feared as a football team for the past _10_ years. Our average ACT score was a 22. Overall I loved thge school and everything it did for me but I was ready to get away from the same old faces evryday.
