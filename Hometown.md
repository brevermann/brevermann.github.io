## Hometown
My hometown is called _Breese_, _IL_. It has a population of around 4,000 people in total. It is a very dense town with not a whole lot to do but it is great. We have 2 stoplights in our entire town and you can drive through its entitrety in about 5 minutes. We are a very rural community. There are fields as far as the eye can see in some directions and thats just the way I like it. This environment is what got my dad into hunting which in turn got me into hunting. Hunting is also a part of life for many if not all in our town. We have our own domestic soda company callee **SKI**, this company also makes domestic IPA's and other seasonal beers. The closest place to get SKI from Columbia is in downtown STL.
