## Hobbies

# Hunting
I _love_ to hunt, whether that be deer, turkey, duck, quial, or even rabbit. Hunting has alwasy played a part in my life. It started when i was just **6** years old. My dad go me into hunting at a young age because he was also very passionate about it at a young age. This was a great way for us to bond together when I was little.

# Fishing
I also started going fishing when I was very litle. I started off only trying to catch maller fish, but as I got older I went after larger game. I usually fish for catfish or largemouth bass today when I go.

# Cards
I enjoy playing any type of card game as well. I play euchre, blackjack, poker, and many many more games. I got into cards at a young age because my grandparents are very big card players and alwasy taught me the games they would play when the family would get together on the holidays.
